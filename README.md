## Features

Navigation bar created using bootstrap, customised using my own CSS to change text-alignment and colors
increased navbar height when viewed on larger devices.

Footer created using fontawesome icons. CSS used for size/color customisation and hover effects added using hover pseudoclass.

======
## Technologies used

This Project uses the following languages:

* HTML
* CSS

[Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework is utalized to structure the website, allowing me to easily create a responsive website
and create a quick and easy to use navigation bar.

Git and GitHub

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the logos of Linkedin, GitHub and Facebook. These logos formed part of the footer 
and were used as links to the sites.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to browse, select and as a source of the font I used on this site.

## Testing

I used the [W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the validity of my code.
This highlighted a number of errors and warnings.

![Screenshot of errors](/assets/images/code_validation_errors.jpg)

The trailing slash at the end of link to the font awesome stylesheet was removed.

I had also used spacing in the names of two of my HTML files and these were replaced with underscores and the 
links updated across the navigation bar.

These errors occured as i had missed the closing tag for the anchor elements in the footer, these were added in.

As these elements navigation and footer were present in all pages, the corrections were made for all files and 
following that my code passed the validations and no more errors or warnings were given.
